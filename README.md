# TradeCentric Xframe Module 

## Composer Installation
TradeCentric uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage our Adobe Commerce modules and their dependencies, this assumes that you 
already have Composer installed and a composer.json file exists in your Magento installations root directory. 

<br>

If you are currently using the **“Direct Installation from Zip Archive”** method, TradeCentric would strongly recommend you to implement 
**Composer** to manage your Adobe Commerce and TradeCentric components and their dependencies.
